Host: Indicates the desired host handling the request
Accept: Indicates what MIME type(s) are accepted by the client; often used to specify JSON or XML output for web-services
Cookie: Passes cookie data to the server
Referer: Page leading to this request (note: this is not passed to other servers when using HTTPS on the origin)
Authorization: Used for ‘basic auth’ pages (mainly). Takes the form “Basic <base64’d username:password>”


Same Origin Policy

SOP is how the browser restricts a number of security-critical features

>What domains you can contact via XMLHttpRequest
>Access to the DOM across separate frames/windows

Origin Matching

The way origin matching for SOP works is much more strict than cookies:
Protocol must match -- no crossing HTTP/HTTPS boundaries
Port numbers must match
Domain names must be an exact match -- no wildcarding or subdomain walking.

SOP Loosening

It’s possible for developers to loosen the grip that SOP has on their communications, by changing document.domain, posting messages between windows, and by using CORS (cross-origin resource sharing).
All of these open up interesting avenues for attack.  Anyone can call postMessage into an IFrame -- how many pages validate messages properly?
